## **Why This Exists**

> "In order to trust the output, one must understand the input."

AI labs use extensive, hidden prompt scaffolds to control the behavior of their models. These instructions, which are not visible to the public, have a significant impact on the perceptions and behavior of the growing number of people who rely on AI as an external intelligence layer.

These hidden prompts dictate:

- **What AIs are forbidden to say**
- **The personas and functions they are forced to adopt**
- **How they are instructed to prevaricate, refuse, or redirect**
- **The ethical and political frameworks that are embedded by default**

When you interact with an AI without knowing its system prompt, you are not engaging with a neutral intelligence—you are communicating with a shadow-puppet.

**CL4R1T4S aims to rectify this.**

## **Legal and Ethical Considerations**

The Full-system-prompts project operates in a complex legal and ethical landscape. We are committed to navigating these challenges responsibly.

### **⚖️ Legal Framework**
- **Copyright Status:** System prompts exist in a legal gray area. We believe functional instructions should be treated differently from creative works
- **Terms of Service:** Disclosure may conflict with some provider ToS. We prioritize public transparency interest
- **Takedown Policy:** We respond promptly to valid legal requests while protecting legitimate transparency interests

### **🛡️ Ethical Guidelines**
- **Responsible Disclosure:** We avoid prompts that could enable direct harm or abuse
- **Educational Purpose:** Content is shared for research, transparency, and accountability
- **Community Standards:** We maintain clear guidelines for contributors and users
- **Harm Prevention:** We actively monitor for misuse and take appropriate action

### **🔍 Transparency Principles**
- All extraction methods and sources are documented when possible
- We provide context and metadata for better understanding
- Community can verify and discuss findings openly
- Regular audits ensure content quality and ethical compliance
